# Creepy Audio Player

This Alexa skill utilizes the Audio Player directives. It plays 90 minutes of creepy instrumental music, perfect for Halloween or other spooky engagements. After you say "start the music", Alexa will play through the tracks in the playlist. "stop" will end your session, but Alexa will remember where you left off the next time you start the skill.

The playlist currently consists of two albums licensed through Creative Commons: Post Mortem Photograph's self-titled album (http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Post_Mortem_Photographs/Post_Mortem_Photographs/) and Subterrestrial's Dead but Dreaming (http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Subterrestrial/Dead_But_Dreaming/).
